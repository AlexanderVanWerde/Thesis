The purpose of this thesis is provide a improved estimate for the zero locust of Bernstein-Sato ideals.\\

Historically, this problem arose when trying to extend a function to the entire complex plane.
Let $f\in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ be some fixed positive polynomial and $g \in \mathcal{C}_c^\infty$ be some test function.
Gelfand asked if it is possible to find a meromorphic extension of the function
$$\Gamma_g(s) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} g f^s dx; \qquad \operatorname{Re}(s)>0 $$
to the entire complex plane.
A proof by Bernstein relies on the existence of a differential operator $P(x,\partial, s)$ such that
$$P(x,\partial,s) f^{s+1} = b_f(s) f^s$$
for some polynomial $b_f(s)\in \C[s]$.
The monic polynomial of minimal degree is called the Bernstein-Sato polynomial.
In particular, this method shows that any pole of $\Gamma_g$ is a root of $b_f(s)$ up a shift with a negative integer.\\

The relation between the roots of $b(s)$ and the poles of functions like $\Gamma_g$ is the topic of a notable open problem called the monodromy conjecture.
Futher, the roots of $b_f(s)$ give some insight into the behaviour of the ill-defined function $f^{-1}$ and the nature of the singularities.
Suppose that $f(0)= 0$ and consider $f$ as a function germ $f:(\C^n,0)\to (\C,0)$.
Let $t\in \C^\times$ be close to $0$ and consider the intersection $X_t := f^{-1}(t)\cap B_\varepsilon$ where $B_\varepsilon$ is some small ball centered at $0$.
Twisting $t$ around the origin induces a diffeomorphism $M$ of $X_t$ which is called the geometric monodromy.
In particular, one gets linear endomorphisms $M^*$ on the vector spaces $H^j(X_t,\C)$.
The action $M^*$ only depends on the singularity $(f^{-1}(0),0)$.
In particular, the eigenvalues of the action are invariants of the singularity.
These eigenvalues are called the eigenvalues of monodromy.
A classical theorem due to Malgrange and Kashiwara estabilshes that the eigenvalues of monodromy are precisely the set $\exp(Z(b_f))$ where $Z(b_f)$ denotes the collection of roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial.

This shows that the roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial are a worthy topic of study.
Estimation of the roots of the Bernstein-Sato polynomial has been done in terms of data from a resolution of singularities.
The resolution reduces the problem to the case where $f$ is a monomial in which case the Bernstein-Sato polynomial can be computed explicitly.
The main difficulty is to connect the easier problem to the original problem.
This relies on the sheaf-theoretic framework of $\D_X$-modules and their direct images.
Here $\D_X$ denotes the sheaf of differential operators on a space $X$.

The original estimate due to Kashiwara establishes that the roots of $b(s)$ are negative rational numbers.
A lower bound for the distance between the largest root and $0$ was established by Lichtin.
This refined estimate uses a similar methodology to Kashiwara but replaced $f^s$ with the distribution $f^s dx$.
\\

In this thesis a multivariate generalization of the problem is considered.
Let $F:(\C^{n},0)\to (\C^p,0)$ be a function germ with coordinate functions $f_1,\ldots, f_p$ and define variables $s_1,\ldots, s_p$.
It is then still known that there exists a differential operator $P(x,\partial, s)$ such that
$$P(x,\partial,s) f_1^{s_1 + 1}\cdots f_p^{s_p + 1} = b(s)f_1^{s_1}\cdots f_p^{s_p}$$
for some polynomial $b(s) \in \C[s_1,\ldots, s_p]$.
The collection of all possible polynomial $b(s)$ form an ideal of $\C[s_1,\ldots,s_p]$ which is called the Bernstein-Sato ideal and is denoted $B_{F}$.
The roots of Bernstein-Sato polynomials are generalised by the zero locust $Z(B_F)$.

There are generalisations of the monodromy conjecture and monodromy theorem to the multivariate situation involving $Z(B_F)$.
Kashiwara's estimate for the roots of $b(s)$ has been generalised to a estimation of the Bernstein-Sato ideal by Budur et al.
This thesis also generalises the refined estimate due to Lichtin.

There are two main steps.
Firstly, one must check that the properties of the direct images of $\D_X$-modules generalise to $\D_X\langle s_1,\ldots, s_p \rangle$-modules.
Then, a inductive argument is used to reduce the number of $s_i$ to one.
Homological algebra is used to control error terms of the induction process.\\

The first chapter in this thesis gives a overview of various known results for $\D_X$-modules.
This builds up to the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence which is a broad generalisation of the the equivalence between systems of differential equations and their solutions.
The second chapter generalises notions for $\D_X$-modules to $\D_X\langle s_1,\ldots, s_p \rangle$-modules and contains the proof for the improved estimate of $Z(B_F)$.\todo{Rewrite}
