\chapter*{Preface}
An, allegedly ancient Chinese, curse goes: may you live in interesting times.
The past year has occupied me with the writing of this master's thesis during a global pandemic.
In the process I have gained a great deal of knowledge and mathematical maturity.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank a few people without whom this journey would have been much less rewarding.\\

\noindent
First of all I thank my supervisor, Prof. Nero Budur, who allowed me a great deal of independence and provided valuable criticism.
The feedback has influenced, and hopefully improved, my writing style as a mathematician.
I also want to thank Robin van der Veer who set me on my tracks, provided guidance and helped me to see the geometry behind the technicalities. 
Further, I thank my readers Dr. Guillem Blanco and Dr. Paula Mac\^edo Lins de Araujo.
\\

\noindent
I would also like to express my gratitude to my parents for their support and for their tolerance of my, often failed, attempts to explain why concept-$x$ is so great.
I promise that, from now on, you will not have to endure any more explanations of algebraic geometry.
Instead you'll get to enjoy a range of other mathematical topics which may prove to be equally confusing. Likewise to my friends.\\[2em]
